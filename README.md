# ball-droppings-2
an unofficial homage/expansion of the classic BallDroppings (http://balldroppings.com/).


a Godot 2.1.4/GDscript learning project. credit to Josh Nimoy for the original concept.


## this brings:

* hexagons: bounce less, disappear after two or three impacts, sound deep af
* dotted lines: hold ctrl to place. these don't affect ball/hexagon movement but make a shakey sound


## coming soon:

* bpm sliders for hex and ball release speed on a...
* proper collapsible menu, also containing a...
* button to invert gravity.
* various useful keyboard shortcuts
* saving and loading
