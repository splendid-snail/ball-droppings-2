# ball-droppings-2
an unofficial homage/expansion of the classic BallDroppings (http://balldroppings.com/).


a Godot 2.1.4/GDscript learning project. credit to JT Nimoy for the original concept.


## this brings:

* hexagons: bounce less, disappear after two or three impacts, sound deep af
* dotted lines: hold ctrl to place. these don't affect ball/hexagon movement but make a shakey sound
* a collapsible menu with sliders for spawn rate, and a flip gravity button


## coming soon:

* tweaks to controls
* more fun menu features
* various useful keyboard shortcuts
* improved *aesthetic*
* saving and loading
* and possibly new, selectable sound sets
